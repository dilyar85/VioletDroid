Week 3

Functional specification (what the project will do) is complete: Mostly

A sketch of the UI would be helpful

There is some design documentation (key classes, mechanisms, protocols): Ok

Add information about the non-Android part. Are you reusing the existing Violet structure? 

There are sufficient issues to keep each team member busy for week 4: No

You aren't making effective use of the issue tracker. An issue is assigned to a SINGLE PERSON and has a 
SHORT DURATION (< 3 days). With 4 team members, there should be 8 - 12 open issues, keeping everyone
busy with tasks that can be predictably accomplished.

Each team member has closed at least two issues and has put the closed issue number(s) in their report: No

No report from Lance
Saifuding - list WHICH issues closed
Yan - No issues closed

The project builds and does something useful. Put instructions for building and for trying out that useful feature on the wiki:
