  "body": "### Introduction \r\nVioletDroid is an Android app that allows users to draw UML diagrams on their phones and tablets.\r\n![code package image] (url)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Android Framework\r\n* VioletDroid uses Activity - Fragment template to accomplish its major feature. \r\n![code package image] (url)\r\n* RecyclerView with corresponding adapter displays the elements needed in UML diagrams.\r\n![code package image] (url)\r\n* Static methods in the Utility class to help implement its feature and avoid duplicated codes.\r\n![code package image] (url)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Design Patterns\r\nVioletDroid uses two major design patterns: Decorator Pattern, Composite Pattern, and Observer Pattern.\r\n\r\n* **Decorator Pattern**：  \r\nRecyclerAdapter class extends Android’s native RecyclerView.Adapter to display the icons in the toolbar menu as a scrolling dataset of images.  This is an example of the decorator pattern used in the Android API—RecyclerView essentially decorates an Android ViewGroup to provide the additional scrolling functionality and link to a dataset of assets for the view.  The following table represents this pattern:\r\n![decorator pattern image] url\r\n\r\n* **Composite Pattern**：  \r\nThe composite pattern is used in the VioletDroid CanvasLayout class which extends Android’s native RelativeLayout class, which extends the ViewGroup abstract class which extends View.  So CanvasLayout is a ViewGroup, which is a View that can contain other Views.  The following table represents this pattern in our project:\r\n![composite pattern image] url\r\n\r\n* **Observer Pattern**：  \r\nThe observer pattern is another very common occurrence in User Interface design, particularly with Graphical User Interfaces, since the signal for the application to do something comes from the user’s interaction with elements on-screen, those elements must somehow notify the application what has happened - hence the listeners involved in an observer pattern:\r\n![observer pattern image] url\r\n\r\n### Service Framework\r\nWe utilized a cloud service framework in our project to facilitate user account maintenance and saving of diagrams.   We mention it here because it provides our project with a huge suite of services that we didn’t actually have to code ourselves, but merely \r\nimport com.avos.avoscloud.AVOSCloud; \r\nand add 3 lines of initialization for the framework at app startup.\r\n\r\n### Run Demo\r\n1. Start your emulator.\r\n2. Via bash, navigate to the VioletDroid project folder.\r\n3. Execute:~> ./exec.sh\r\n\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n![available on Google Play] url\r\n\r\n",
